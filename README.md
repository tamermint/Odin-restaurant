# Odin-restaurant

As part of Odin project's path to becoming a full stack developer. Learning npm by doing :)

-This is the first project in my portfolio where I am using npm as a package manager for my project.

-Aim is to create a restaurant page by dynamically generating DOM contents and making it responsive.

-This would mean minifying or uglifying, using webpack to compile and html plugin to serve webpages and then finally hosting it - will be specifying where or if it'll all local host.
